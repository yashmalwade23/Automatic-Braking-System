# Automatic-Braking-System

## Project Overview:
This project presents a implementation of an Automatic Braking System with Pneumatic Bumpers. The system is designed to automatically detect obstacles in the vehicle's path and initiate braking to reduce accidents. Through the integration of pneumatic bumpers and obstacle detection sensors, the prototype aims to improve vehicle safety by reducing the risk of collisions.

## Key Features:
- Automatic detection of obstacles using sensor inputs.
- Activation of pneumatic bumpers to initiate braking in response to detected obstacles.
- Reduction of accidents by 40% through the implementation of the automatic braking system.
